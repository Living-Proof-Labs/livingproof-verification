# livingproof-verification

Living Proof Labs' own thin verification project. It is a practical example of how a customer uses the shared Living Proof tools to verify selected robot configurations and publish evidence-backed results.

The planned contents are declarative verification definitions, reviewed dependency locks, thin local and CI entry points through `livingproof`, an explicit selection of runs and series for reporting, and publishing configuration. Grading stays in `capability-verifier`, and rendering stays in `livingproof-capability-report`. This repository supplies only the inputs and the records.

Scope and acceptance criteria: [Living-Proof-Labs/.github#11](https://github.com/Living-Proof-Labs/.github/issues/11).

## What is here

- `verifications/*.toml`: declarative definitions. Each one selects a robot repository, a ref and the configurations to verify. The robot repository's own `verification.lock.json` supplies the world, simulator runner, specs, trial plan, verifier and reporter releases.
- `verifications/*.lock.json`: the reviewed lock for each definition. It records the robot commit, the sha256 of the robot's lock, and the releases that lock names.
- `.github/workflows/verify.yml`: a thin call to the capability verifier's reusable `walk-hallway.yml` at the locked verifier commit, passing the locked robot repository, commit and configurations.

The first definition is `unitree-g1-stock-mujoco-hallway`: Unitree G1 with its stock controller in the MuJoCo hallway, 20 seeded trials.

## Run a verification locally

You need git, jq, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), Docker (for the locked reporter image), and OSMesa (`libosmesa6` on Debian or Ubuntu). Install `livingproof` with the capability verifier plugin in one environment:

```sh
uv venv .venv
VIRTUAL_ENV=.venv uv pip install \
  "livingproof-common @ https://github.com/Living-Proof-Labs/livingproof-common/releases/download/v1.0.0/livingproof_common-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl" \
  "livingproof @ git+https://github.com/Living-Proof-Labs/livingproof@v1.4.9" \
  "capability-verifier @ git+https://github.com/Living-Proof-Labs/capability-verifier@VERIFIER_RELEASE"
```

`VERIFIER_RELEASE` is the first capability-verifier release that ships `livingproof capability verify`.

Check the lock and the workflow call, then run:

```sh
.venv/bin/livingproof capability verify lock --check \
  --workflow .github/workflows/verify.yml verifications/unitree-g1-stock-mujoco-hallway.toml
.venv/bin/livingproof capability verify run verifications/unitree-g1-stock-mujoco-hallway.toml
```

`run` checks out the robot at the locked commit and the verifier at the commit the robot lock names. It then runs the same `walk-hallway.yml` step scripts as CI: plan gates, setup, evidence, assessment, and rendering with the reporter image by digest. Pass `--reporter source` to render without Docker. Recordings (MCAP and video) are CI-only.

Results go to `artifacts/runs/<id>/<configuration>/`:

- `evidence/`: the trials
- `verified/`: the verifier's decisions and bundle
- `reports/`: `report.md`, `.html`, `.json` and `.txt`

A pass/fail tally is written to `artifacts/runs/<id>/summary.json`. Everything under `artifacts/` is generated and ignored by git.

## Change what is verified

Edit a definition, re-lock it, and review the lock diff:

```sh
.venv/bin/livingproof capability verify lock verifications/unitree-g1-stock-mujoco-hallway.toml
```

Then update the call in `.github/workflows/verify.yml` to the new robot commit (and the verifier commit, if the robot lock names a new one). `tests/test_locks.py` (the `locks` CI job, which every verification job waits for) and `lock --check --workflow` fail until the two agree. Both parse the workflow YAML, so a commented-out pin does not count.

## Checks

```sh
uvx ruff@0.14.2 check . && uvx ruff@0.14.2 format --check .
uvx --from pytest==8.4.2 --with pyyaml==6.0.3 pytest
actionlint
```
